Task 1: Advanced Technical Analysis Strategy

Description: • Create a strategy using multiple technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands). The strategy should generate buy/sell signals based on complex conditions involving these indicators. Subtasks:

Collect daily historical data for 100 stocks over the last 5 years using yfinance.
Calculate RSI (Relative Strength Index) for each stock.
Calculate MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) for each stock.
Calculate Bollinger Bands for each stock.
Develop the buy/sell signal logic using a combination of the calculated indicators.
Implement a backtesting framework to simulate trades based on the strategy.
Calculate and record the returns for each trade.
Generate a performance report including key metrics (total returns, annualized returns, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown) for each symbol and make a summary sheet.
Visualize the buy/sell signals and resulting portfolio value over time.
Write a summary report detailing the strategy, implementation, and performance results.

Task 3: Portfolio Optimization with Constraints

Description: • Optimize a portfolio of 100 stocks with constraints on risk, sector allocation, and turnover. Subtasks:

Collect historical price data for 100 stocks over the last 5 years and obtain sector classification for each stock.
Calculate risk metrics for each stock (e.g., standard deviation of returns, Value at Risk).
Create a covariance matrix to assess the correlation between the stocks.
Group stocks by sector and impose constraints on sector allocation (e.g., no more than 20% in any sector).
Limit the portfolio turnover (e.g., no more than 10% rebalanced monthly) and implement a mechanism to track turnover.
Use an optimization algorithm (e.g., mean-variance optimization) to maximize the portfolio's returns while adhering to the constraints.
Backtest the optimized portfolio over the historical period.
Compare the optimized portfolio's performance against a benchmark index (e.g., S&P 500).
Calculate and record key performance metrics (total returns, annualized returns, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, sector allocation analysis).
Write a summary report detailing the optimization process, constraints, implementation, and performance results.
